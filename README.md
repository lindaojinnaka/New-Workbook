# T1A1- Workbook 


## 1. Research the development of the internet from 1980 to today. You must describe ay least FIVE key events in the development of the internet. You can refer to events, people of significance, or technologies and how they have changed over time. 300-500 words. 

The five key events that were significant to the development of the internet were the publication of packet switching theory, the TX-2 computer, the installation of the first IMP,  the public demonstration of the ARPANET, and Lawrence G. R2oberts’ email utility program. 

In 1964, Leonard Kleinrock at MIT published the first paper on packet switching, which was a monumental step towards computer networking. Another significant event which led to the development of the internet, occurred with the arrival of the TX-2 computer. In 1965, Thomas Merrill and Roberts connected the TX-2 computer, which was in Massachusetts, to the Q-32, which was in California. This experiment revealed computers can work together and run programs and retrieve data as necessary. This experiment also further cemented the need for packet switching. Another significant event that led to the development of the internet occurred in 1969. In September 1969, BBN installed the first IMP at UCLA, which led to the connection of the first host computer.  Another significant event that led to the development of the internet was the demonstration of the ARPANET. In October 1972, at the International Computer Communication Conference, Leonard Kleinrock organised a large demonstration that was the first of its kind to the general public. The public demonstration introduced the new network technology to the public which gave way to the electronic mail application being introduced. The last and perhaps one of the most important events that contributed to the development of the internet occurred in July of the same year. In July of 1972, Lawrence G. Roberts wrote a basic email message software in order to help ARPANET developers with an easier way to coordinate and communicate.  Roberts then further expanded this program by adding the first email utility program that files, reads, forwards, and responds to messages. This program was catapulted into the largest network application in a decade. 



## 2. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet: 
-packets
-IP addresses (IPv4 and Ipv) 
-routers and routing 
-domains and DNS 
Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of the internet. (50-100 words per dot point)

Packets contributed to the development of the internet because they dictate how information is sent across the internet.  They are units of communication that are broken up into small pieces which allows the network to handle different bandwidths. The three main sections of a packet are the payload, trailer, and set of headers. Packets also form the units of data within TCP/IP protocols. 

An IP address is a string of numbers separated by periods. Every device that is connected to the internet has a unique IP address. Since IP addresses are made up of a long string of numbers, domain names were created to translate the IP address into a name that is shorter, human readable, and easier to remember.  IPV 4 is short for internet protocol version 4.  This is the fourth version of the Internet Protocol routes internet traffic and is the basis of how information is sent from one device to another using the internet using packet exchanges.

The domain name server is a fundamental part of the internet. The DNS matches the website name that is readable by humans, to the ID of the server of where the website being looked up is stored. Domain names were created as a solution to the problem faced when users would need to recall an IP address to visit a website. IP addresses are made up of a string of numbers that are long and otherwise difficult to remember. Domains solve this problem by assigning the alphabet to these address so words and names that are easy to remember can replace these strings of numbers.  The domain name system turns the domain names into their IP address and brings your device to its intended destination. 

Routers and routing are part of the network infrastructure that make up the internet.  Routers are a physical hardware appliance that passes information between networks that are packet switched.  There are two types of routers: hardware routers and software routers.  Hardware routers have built in software supplied by the manufacturer, while software routers operate similarly to hardware routers but do not have a seperate box. Routing takes data packets to their intended destination. 


## 3. Define the features of the following technologies that are essential in terms of the development of the internet:  (150-300 words per dot point).
Explain how each technology has contributed to the development of client and server communication over the internet (50-150 words for each technology)
-TCP
-HTTP and HTTPS 
-web browsers (requests, rendering and developer and tools) 

TCP stands for Transmission Control Protocol and refers to the set standard of rules of how computers communicate on networks with one another. Actions such as how communication starts, ends, message accuracy, and whose turn it is to communicate is established through protocols and is essential to ensuring that information can be transferred in an orderly fashion. Otherwise, there would be anarchy. TCP was created by the US Department of Defence and was developed with accuracy in mind. Specifically, accuracy on how data is transmitted between two computers. This is done by dividing communication tasks into layers that each have a different objective. The four layers are the data link layer, internet layer, transport layer, and application layer.  These layers  keep everything standardised.


HTTP stands for Hypertext Transfer Protocol. The internet is made up of communication between web clients and web servers. Clients are browsers such as Google Chrome and Safari and web servers are computers in the cloud. Communication between web servers and web clients is carried out through the use of requests and responses. First, a client sends an HTTP request to the web. The web server then receives the request then runs an application to process the request. Next, the server comes back with an HTTP response to the browser and the browser then receives the response.


Web browsers takes a user to any place on the internet.  Web browsers such as Safari, Mozilla, Google Chrome, and Microsoft Edge take information from one from one side of the internet and displays it on the user’s device. HTP transfers the information which is written in HTML that is used to create our auditory and visual experience on the web. The seven key components of a web browser are the layout engine, rendering engine, user interface, JavaScript engine, network layer, storage, and operating system interface. 


## 4. Identify THREE data structures used in the Ruby programming language and explain the reasons for using each. (50-100 words on each data structure).

Arrays, hashes, and binary trees are three data structures in the Ruby programming language. 
Arrays are an ordered collection of values of the same type that are stored in a memory location. Arrays are able to store several values in a data structure while giving the user quick access to the stored elements. A user would use an array to collect items, gather results from running a loop, and more. Any value can be stored in an array and arrays index values starting at 0.
Hashes are quite similar to arrays, as they also store a collection of values in a location. However, in hashes, every value has a key and the key can be symbolic of any piece of information. A hash can also be used to count characters in a string and map words to a dictionary. Hashes are quite like dictionaries as well. There is a key and an identifier. 
Binary trees are used for routing tables, data compression and abstract data trees. In a binary tree structure, each tree has at most two children which are named the left and right child. A binary tree node contains 3 parts: data, pointer to the right child, and pointer to the left child.  The left and right cursor point to smaller trees subtrees on each side, whereas a null pointer represents a binary tree that has no elements. 

## 5. Describe the features of interpreters and compilers and how they are different. (100-200 words on each way code is executed)

A compiler turns code written in a high level language into machine code. The compiler translates human readable code to the language the computer understands, which is binary code. The computer then processes the machine code to execute tasks. First, the compiler creates the program. Next, the compiler parses the program to check to see if the statements are syntactically correct. If there is an error, an error message will be displayed. If there is no error, the program will move onto the next step. Lastly, the compiler links different code files into a file extension then runs the program. 

An interpreter converts each line of a high level language into machine code. First, the interpreter creates the program. Next, the statements are executed line by line during execution.
The difference between a compiler and interpreter is a compiler converts code into machine code and prior to the run of the program, and the interpreter turns code into machine code when the program is run. 


## 6. Identify TWO commonly used programming and explain the benefits and drawbacks of each. (200-400 words on each language).  
Java is a general purpose language that was released by Sun Systems in 1995. Java is one of the most widely used programming languages because it is secure, fast, and able to be used across all platforms. For instance, Java is used in refrigerators, game consoles, super computers, cellphones, and much much more. The “write once- run anywhere” mantra signifies you can write java on one platform and access it on another platform. Also, the syntax is very similar to C and C++ which is benefits to those attempting to learn Java and already proficient in one of the two C languages. One drawback of Java is that it is more tedious to write in comparison to other more human readable languages such as Ruby and Python. The language is verbose and tends to be longer than a program in a different language executing a similar command. 

Python is a programming language known for its elegance and readable code. In fact, Python is so widely praised for its readability, it is recommended to novice programmers. Python code also takes fewer lines to write which saves time. Python is also known for its large global community and there is a wide availability for Python frameworks.  One drawback of Python is that it is an interpreted language. Because of this, it runs slower than other compiled languages. Another drawback of Python is that there are not many smartphone applications developed with Python and is not in web browsers. 


## 7. Identify two ethical issues from the areas below and discuss the extent to which an IT professional is ethically responsible in terms of the issue. (200-400 words per ethical issue)
Access to a user’s personal information (medical, family, financial, personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs.

An It professional is ethically responsible to never disclose a user’s personal information including medical, family, financial, and personal attributes such as sexuality, religion, or beliefs. Additionally, this personal information should never be sold to a third party, or given to another company for any reason at all. Disclosing a user’s information on the basis of profit would be a violation of the user’s trust and privacy.   However, there are a few exceptions where the IT processional would be ethically responsible to hand over this information. One case would be if the professional were ordered by law to disclose the user’s personal information. Another case it would be necessary to access this information would be if it were necessary to do so in order to provide the service the user signed up for. . Also, according to the Privacy Act 1988, when a customers information is no longer needed, the professional must destroy or de-identify it. 

Intellectual property is property that pertains to the mind or knowledge. This can include trademarks, copyright, inventions, and branding.  The Copyright Act of 1968 applies to materials such as dramatic, literary, artistic, and musical works as well as published editions, recordings, and broadcasts. The person who has creates or makes the work at hand is the owner and therefore owns the copyright of of the work produced. An IT professional will come across many projects while freelancing and otherwise and its his or her responsibility to ensure they do not copy or steal any work that does not belong to them. 

## 8. Explain control flow, using an example from the Ruby programming language. 100 words 
Control flow is the order in which statements are evaluated and executed in a program. 
Some examples of control flow programs are if statements and programs with loops. An if statement tells a program to run based on whether or not a particular instruction or piece of code given is true. If the condition is met, the program runs, if the condition is not met nothing happens. In the case of ifels statements, a piece of code is given to the computer to execute if the first condition is not met. 
Below is a control flow example in Ruby. 
raining = true
tempereature = 20

(CONDITION 1) if raining and temperature <15 
puts "its wet and cold"

(CONDITION 2) elsif temperature <15 and not raining 
puts "it's not raining but cold"

CONDITION 3) elsif temperature>=15 and not raining 
puts "its warmn but not raining"

else 
CONDITION 4) puts "it's warm and raining".

end


The two variable raining, and temperature are set at the beginning of the program in order to tell the computer which lines of code to execute.  If the first condition is not met, the program moves to the second condition. If the second condition is not met, the program moved on to the next condition. If the first three conditions are not met, the program runs the else statement “It’s warm and raining.”



## 9. Explain type coercion. 100 words 
Type coercion is the conversion of values from one data type to another. For instance, a floating point value that is changed into an integer would be an example of type coercion. Type coercion would be used in order to allow programs to work. Changing  a number to a string so that it could concatenate with another string would be an example of type coercion. Type coercion is also very similar to type casting, type conversion, and type juggling. There are different operators that can be used to convert one data type to another. Primarily, the  double equals (==)  operator, and the + operator are used to convert on data type to another.  
Explicit type coercion occurs when the developer uses code to covert between types. 
Implicit type coercion occurs when a language such as Javascript has its different types converted automatically.


## 10. Explain data types, using examples.   100 words 
Data types specifies the type of value a variable has. There are two types of data types: primitive data types and non-primitive data types. Primitive data types include short, byte, long, int, float, double, char and below. Below are examples of each data type.
Short: 125 
byte: 200
boolean: true
long: 23,434,445
int: 4
float: 4.09f
double: 4.09 
char: ‘a’  

Non-primitive data types are stings, classes, and arrays. Below are examples of the three:

String: hello
classes: public class {
}
array: [2,5,7,9,5]





## 12. Identify and explain the code error in the snippet below. 
The celsius variable needs to be converted to an integer before the program can convert celsius to fahrenheit. “.chomp” also needs to be added to removed the new line that appears when the user hits enter.
# celsius = gets.chomp.to_i

```ruby
celsius = gets.chomp.to_i
fahrenheit = (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32
print "The result is: "
print fahrenheit
puts "."
```

## 13. The code snippet looks for the first two elements out of order and swaps them. Rewrite the code so that it works correctly.

arr = [5, 19, 29, 39, 51, 78, 96, 84]
i = 0
while (i < arr.size - 1 and arr[i] < arr[i + 1])
        i = i + 1 end
puts i
    arr[i] = arr[i + 1]
    arr[i + 1] = arr[i]

  

## 15. Write pseudocode for the following probolem. 
raining = true
tempereature = 20

(CONDITION 1) if raining and temperature <15 
puts "its wet and cold"

(CONDITION 2) elsif temperature <15 and not raining 
puts "it's not raining but cold"

CONDITION 3) elsif temperature>=15 and not raining 
puts "its warmn but not raining"

else 
CONDITION 4) puts "it's warm and raining".

End




## 16: Write a program that, given a person’s score can tell them 
a) whether or not they're allergic to a given item
b) the full list of allergies. 

FOODS = {
    'eggs' => 1, 
    'peanuts' => 2,
    'shellfish' => 4,
    'strawberries' => 8,
    'tomatoes' => 16,
    'chocolate' => 32,
    'pollen' => 64,
    'cats' => 128,  

}

puts "Enter allergy score:"
score= gets.chomp.to_i 

FOODS.each_key do |food|
   allergic = (score & FOODS [food] 0)
   puts "Allergic tp #{food}: #{allergic}"
   end
